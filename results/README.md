# c18-virus-model
DMAS Project 20/21

Code for generating results.

### Summary
The results in this folder were generated to investigate the effect of the participation rate in contact tracing on infection incidence and other statistics of interest. Different values of the participation rate were simulated several times over 2000 steps. The results can be found in `output.csv` and are processed and displayed in `results.ipynb`.
These results can also be generated by yourself (or modified if desired) by using or changing the `bulk_experiments.txt` in this `results` folder.
Then (from the main project folder) run:
```shell
$ python run_bulk_experiments.py results/bulk_experiments.txt
```
This generates the associated `output.csv` in the main project folder.
