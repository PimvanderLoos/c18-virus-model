1. initialize VirusModel. Here we can adjust the amount of agents and the grid.
    Also we can give the agents different schedules here by giving a variable to the agent
    ID and give it to the constructer of VirusAgent. Here we can also give atributes to the agent.
    THe variabe can give the atribute of which schedule is used.
    Make a variable which tells how much schedules are with different people.
    Makr variable of how close people are sitting next to each other.
    Variable one makes sure that people are in classes with the same people.
    Variable 2 makes sure how close they can sit next to each other.

    The atribute grid contains the rooms. In here the lecture rooms atributes and values are stated.
    These values will be used to place agents in some seat.

    The class room similarity is not interesting because class rooms are alway homogenous.
    What is interesting is how much agents will take the same seat as before.
    Make a measure of how far an agent can devide from a seat.
    When this is 100% then the person can only sit on one spot in every lecture hall.
    If it is zero then agets can pick random over all seats.
