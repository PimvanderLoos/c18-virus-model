Implementation:
1. Implement spread distance and chance from theory.
2. Chance the simulation so that the time it takes until agent is pulled out of simulation is more realistic
    Or let it be instant in one step.
3. Change that all infected people can die and not only the positive tested agents.
4. Include formal testing on the results of the simulation.
5. Choose the length of the simulation.

Raport:
  1. Research on spread chance and distance. 
  2. Research how long it would take before an agent would be tested and until the other agent will get pulled out of the simulation.
      We can look up how the corona apps in NL and DE work says Malvin.
  3. Show reults of formal tests and use as argument which measures work well in which case.
    This formal testing explenation should be explained in the expeprimental design, choose t-test, wilcoxon or maybe ANOVA.
